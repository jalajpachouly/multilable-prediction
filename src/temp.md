The provided script requires a few corrections to ensure that all tables and figures are referred to at least once in the text, and that references are relevant to the sentences in which they appear. Below are the highlighted changes needed:

1. **Table \ref{tab:github_query} Not Referred in the Text:**

   - **Issue:** The table titled "Sample GitHub Query to Fetch Multi-Label Defects" (`Table \ref{tab:github_query}`) is not mentioned or referenced in the text.
   - **Suggested Change:** Include a sentence that refers to the table, for example:
     > *Table~\ref{tab:github_query} provides an example of such a query used to retrieve defects with multiple labels.*

2. **Figures \ref{fig:wordcloud_documentation} and \ref{fig:wordcloud_enhancement} Not Referred in the Text:**

   - **Issue:** The figures showing word clouds for "Documentation" (`Figure \ref{fig:wordcloud_documentation}`) and "Enhancement" (`Figure \ref{fig:wordcloud_enhancement}`) are not referenced in the text.
   - **Suggested Change:** Add references to these figures in the "Word Cloud Analysis" subsection, such as:
     > *As depicted in Figures~\ref{fig:wordcloud_documentation} and \ref{fig:wordcloud_enhancement}, the most frequent terms associated with the "Documentation" and "Enhancement" defect types provide insights into...*

3. **Inconsistency in the Number of Defect Categories:**

   - **Issue:** The text mentions "five defect categories" in the "Word Cloud Analysis" subsection, whereas only four labels are defined earlier.
   - **Suggested Change:** Either correct the number in the "Word Cloud Analysis" subsection to "four defect categories" or explain and include the fifth category if applicable.

4. **Tables \ref{tab:balanced_results} and \ref{tab:imbalanced_results} Not Referred in the Text:**

   - **Issue:** The tables summarizing model performance on balanced and unbalanced datasets (`Table \ref{tab:balanced_results}` and `Table \ref{tab:imbalanced_results}`) are not mentioned in the text.
   - **Suggested Change:** Reference these tables in the "Observations" or "Results" sections, for example:
     > *As shown in Table~\ref{tab:balanced_results}, the model performance improved significantly after balancing the dataset.*
     > *Table~\ref{tab:imbalanced_results} summarizes the performance metrics on the unbalanced dataset.*

5. **Figures \ref{fig:f1_score_distribution_unbalanced} and \ref{fig:f1_score_distribution_balanced} Not Referred in the Text:**

   - **Issue:** The figures displaying the F1-Score distributions for unbalanced and balanced datasets are not referenced.
   - **Suggested Change:** Include references to these figures in the "Results" section, such as:
     > *Figures~\ref{fig:f1_score_distribution_unbalanced} and \ref{fig:f1_score_distribution_balanced} illustrate the F1-Score distributions across different models before and after dataset balancing, respectively.*

6. **Figures \ref{fig:all_metrics_comparison_unbalanced} and \ref{fig:all_metrics_comparison_balanced} Not Referred in the Text:**

   - **Issue:** The box plots comparing evaluation metrics for unbalanced and balanced datasets are not mentioned.
   - **Suggested Change:** Add references to these figures where appropriate, for example:
     > *The comparative analysis of all evaluation metrics is depicted in Figures~\ref{fig:all_metrics_comparison_unbalanced} and \ref{fig:all_metrics_comparison_balanced} for unbalanced and balanced datasets, respectively.*

7. **Ensure All References Are Relevant and Correct:**

   - **Issue:** In the "Data Analysis" subsection, the dataset is referenced using \cite{Pachouly2020bibliometric}, which is a bibliometric survey and may not be directly relevant to the dataset used.
   - **Suggested Change:** Verify that the cited reference appropriately supports the sentence. If a more relevant reference exists (e.g., a dataset source or a paper detailing the dataset), replace it accordingly.

8. **Additional Clarification Needed for "Five Defect Categories":**

   - **Issue:** The mention of "five defect categories" conflicts with the earlier definition of four labels.
   - **Suggested Change:** Clarify the discrepancy by defining all five categories if applicable or correcting the number to four.

9. **Consistency in Terminology and Labels:**

   - **Issue:** Ensure consistent use of labels throughout the document (e.g., "type\_blocker", "type\_bug").
   - **Suggested Change:** Review the document to maintain consistent terminology for defect types and labels.

10. **Relevance of References in Sentences:**

    - **Issue:** The reference to \cite{Kandel2011DataWrangling} in the context of generating word clouds may not be directly relevant.
    - **Suggested Change:** Ensure that \cite{Kandel2011DataWrangling} is appropriate for the discussion on word clouds or replace it with a more relevant citation that specifically addresses word cloud analysis.

**Summary of Changes Needed:**

- Reference all tables and figures in the text at least once.
- Resolve inconsistencies regarding the number of defect categories.
- Verify that all references are relevant to their associated sentences.
- Ensure consistency in the use of technical terms and labels throughout the document.

By addressing these issues, the coherence and clarity of the manuscript will be improved, ensuring that readers can easily follow the analysis and understand the significance of the figures, tables, and references presented.
